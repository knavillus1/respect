 # TASKPRD-PROVISIONAL1: Feature/Capability Tasks

*Parent*: PRD-<id>: <Parent PRD Title>  

## Workspace Scope
Declare the scope of the work with root path and other descriptive language

## Pre-Development Project Tree
[Tree view of the *before* state of the project module being developed in these tasks]

## Relevant Files
[Existing files to reference during development, including critical and key components involved but not modified, and all reference files specified in the parent PRD.]

### Proposed New Files
[Example]
- `path/to/new/component_or_module.ext` - Purpose and role in the implementation.
- `path/to/new/component_or_module.test.ext` - Unit tests for the new component/module.
- `path/to/new/api_or_service.ext` - Endpoint/service for core capability.
- `path/to/new/api_or_service.test.ext` - Tests for the API/service.
### Existing Files Modified
- `path/to/existing/module.ext` - Brief reason for modification.
- `path/to/existing/module.test.ext` - Updated tests for the modified module.

## Implementation Tasks

### TASK-PROVISIONAL1: Define data model and validation
*Implements*: REQ-1, REQ-2  
*Description*: Define data structures and validation rules for core entities involved in this feature.  
*Acceptance Criteria*:
- Data model covers all required fields with clear types and constraints  
- Validation rules prevent invalid inputs and edge cases  
- Model is documented and agreed upon with the team  
*Reference*:
- `path/to/docs/data-model-guidelines.md` (optional)

### TASK-PROVISIONAL2: Build user interface/workflow
*Implements*: REQ-1, REQ-2  
*Description*: Implement the user interface (or CLI/workflow) to capture inputs and guide the user through the process.  
*Acceptance Criteria*: 
- Input fields enforce validation with clear feedback  
- UI presents available options and states appropriately  
- Submission triggers the corresponding service/API  
- Accessibility and basic responsiveness are considered  

### TASK-PROVISIONAL3: Implement service/API endpoint
*Implements*: REQ-1, REQ-2  
*Description*: Implement a service or API endpoint to process requests and apply business rules.  
*Acceptance Criteria*:
- Validates and sanitizes inputs  
- Returns meaningful errors for invalid requests  
- Performs required persistence/side effects reliably  
- Meets the target response time (e.g., P95 â‰¤ acceptable threshold)  

### TASK-PROVISIONAL4: Set up data storage/schema
*Implements*: REQ-1  
*Description*: Define and apply storage schema (database, files, or other) with necessary constraints and indexes.  
*Acceptance Criteria*:
- Schema includes required fields and relationships  
- Appropriate constraints and indexes are in place  
- Migration/DDL scripts are idempotent and documented  
*Reference*:
- `path/to/docs/storage-schema-guidelines.md` (optional)

### TASK-PROVISIONAL5: Prepare configuration/seed data
*Implements*: REQ-2  
*Description*: Provide configuration/seed data required for the feature, with validation and clear structure.  
*Acceptance Criteria*:
- Config/seed definitions include all required fields and defaults  
- Data is easy to modify and validate  
- Loading process is deterministic and documented
