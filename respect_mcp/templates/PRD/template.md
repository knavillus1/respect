# PRD-PROVISIONAL1: Feature/Capability Title 

## Overview
Brief summary of the feature or capability, its purpose, target users, and the value it delivers.

## Technical Considerations
List anticipated technical decisions (language, frameworks, services, data stores), key constraints (performance, security, compliance), and notable risks.

## Workspace Scope
Define repository root(s), in/out-of-scope areas, and any constraints or assumptions that bound the work.

## Reference Files
List relevant background, design docs, issues/specs, and external references with paths and short descriptions.

## Architecture

### ADR-PROVISIONAL2: Core Architecture Decision

**Context and Problem Statement**
Describe the core architectural problem and context for this feature/capability. The solution should meet scalability, performance, reliability, and maintainability goals appropriate to the system.

**Decision Drivers**
- Performance objectives
- Data consistency and integrity
- Scalability expectations
- Maintainability and operability
- Team expertise and infrastructure constraints

**Considered Options**
1. **Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL)** — Structured schema with ACID transactions
2. **Document Store (e.g., MongoDB/Cosmos DB)** — Flexible schema and horizontal scale
3. **In-Memory Cache (e.g., Redis/Memcached)** — Low-latency access with optional persistence
4. **Local/File/Object Storage** — Simple files or object store (e.g., S3, local JSON)

**Decision Outcome**
Chosen option: **[OPTION NAME]**

**Rationale**
[Explain why this option was chosen, including trade-offs]

**Positive Consequences**
- [List benefits of this decision]
- [Performance/maintainability improvements]

**Negative Consequences**
- [List drawbacks or limitations]
- [Technical debt or complexity introduced]

**Implementation Notes**
- [Specific implementation details]

## Requirements

### REQ-PROVISIONAL3: Requirement A
*Pattern*: Event-driven  
*Statement*: WHEN <trigger/event>, THEN the system SHALL <observable outcome/behavior>.  
*Rationale*: Why this behavior is needed and the value it provides.  
*Fit*: Quantified acceptance criteria (e.g., limits, ranges, formats, timing).  
*Priority*: Must  

### REQ-PROVISIONAL4: Requirement B
*Pattern*: State-driven  
*Statement*: WHILE <system state/condition>, THEN the system SHALL <capability/constraint>.  
*Rationale*: Why this is important in this state and how it supports user or system goals.  
*Fit*: Clear measurable criteria to validate compliance (counts, formats, thresholds).  
*Priority*: Must
