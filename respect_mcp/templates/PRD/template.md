## Architecture

### ADR-PROVISIONAL2: Character Data Storage Architecture

**Context and Problem Statement**
We need to decide how to store and manage character data (name, race, class, stats) for the character creation system. The solution must be scalable, performant, and maintainable.

**Decision Drivers**
- Performance requirements for character loading
- Data consistency and integrity
- Scalability for multiple concurrent users
- Development team expertise
- Infrastructure constraints

**Considered Options**
1. **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)** - Traditional RDBMS approach
2. **Document Database (MongoDB)** - NoSQL document store
3. **In-Memory Cache (Redis)** - Fast access with persistence
4. **Local File Storage** - Simple JSON/XML files

**Decision Outcome**
Chosen option: **[OPTION NAME]**

**Rationale**
[Explain why this option was chosen, including trade-offs]

**Positive Consequences**
- [List benefits of this decision]
- [Performance/maintainability improvements]

**Negative Consequences**
- [List drawbacks or limitations]
- [Technical debt or complexity introduced]

**Implementation Notes**
- [Specific implementation details]

## Requirements

### REQ-PROVISIONAL3: Character name input
*Pattern*: Event-driven  
*Statement*: WHEN a player starts a new game, THEN the system SHALL allow entering a character name.  
*Rationale*: Players need unique identity for their character.  
*Fit*: Name must be 3-20 characters, alphanumeric only.  
*Priority*: Must  

### REQ-PROVISIONAL4: Race selection
*Pattern*: State-driven  
*Statement*: WHILE in character creation mode, THEN the system SHALL provide selectable race options with stat modifiers.  
*Rationale*: Race affects gameplay mechanics and character progression.  
*Fit*: Minimum 4 race options (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc).  
*Priority*: Must
